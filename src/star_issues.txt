star problems:

 - implicit things
   - end of data block implied by open of next data/global or end of file.  no explicit end
   - no explicit end of loop block

 - redundancy
   - 5 ways to create a data value

 - special cases
   - reserved words

 - context dependence
   - type 1 data values preceded by blank; type 2 by a terminate.  what's the point?
   - ; can begin ;-bounded string or non_quoted_I_string

 - case-insensitivity
   - save_ or SAVE_
   
 - delimited strings
   - don't have escape characters -- so can't have all characters in a string
   - the closing character depends on its following context for its meaning:
      i.e. 'a'' is a valid string, whereas 'a' ' is a valid string followed by space '
      
      
      
files with problems:

  - bmrb24, line 816:   [amino-[[(4S)-4,5-diamino-5-oxo-pentyl]amino]methylidene]azanium
    this isn't a [] bounded string, since it has characters after the last balancing ],
    but also isn't a non-quoted string since those can't begin with [
